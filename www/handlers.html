      <h1>Handlers</h1>
      <p>
        The handler components that Ame provides are responsible for the
        serialization, validation, and saving of edits made inline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Handlers are designed to be generic, and should be compatible with
        any JSON based API that can handle cross-origin requests.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="main">
      <h2 id="formatting">Formatting your markup</h2>
      <p>
        In order to serialize the current HTML document as something that can
        be saved to an API (JSON), Ame requires certain attributes on elements
        which provide metadata about data they represent.
      </p>
      <p>
        These attributes are:
        <ul class="attributes">
          <li>
            <strong>ame-handler</strong>
            <p>
              The name of the handler. A page may contain multiple handlers
              for different APIs, which is why this is required.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ame-resource</strong>
            <p>
              The name of the resource that this data is related to. A resource
              usually relates to a specific API path, like /node/1. In a more
              complex setup this could be more abstract, like a UUID that
              relates to metadata about a resource (which could contain a
              label, multiple paths, permissions, etc).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ame-path</strong>
            <p>
              A path which represents where the value from this element should
              be placed in the serialized JSON. Each dot in the path is a new
              nesting level. For example, a path of foo.bar.baz with a value of
              "Hello, world" would serialize to:
              <pre>
                <code class="json">
{
  "foo": {
    "bar": {
      "baz": "Hello, world"
    }
  }
}
                </code>
              </pre>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's use this document tree as an example:
        <pre>
          <code class="html">
&lt;ame-text ame-handler="example" ame-resource="/node/1" ame-path="title.0.value"&gt;My title&lt;/ame-text&gt;
&lt;ame-rich-text ame-handler="example" ame-resource="/node/1" ame-path="body.0.value"&gt;Lorem ipsum!&lt;/ame-rich-text&gt;
&lt;ame-value ame-handler="example" ame-resource="/node/1" ame-path="body.0.format" return="basic_html"&gt;&lt;/ame-value&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
        When serialized by the handler, the resulting JSON should be:
        <pre>
          <code class="json">
{
  "title": {
    "0": {
      "value": "My title"
    }
  }
  "body": {
    "0": {
      "value": "Lorem ipsum!",
      "format": "basic_html"
    }
  }
}
          </code>
        </pre>
        You'll notice that in this example, the ame-value element is used so
        that the value "basic_html" maps to "body.0.format". The format cannot
        be changed inline, but we want to make sure that it's always included
        in the resulting JSON. Structures like this are verbose, but allow
        ame-components to stay generic and not be tied to a single system like
        Drupal.
      </p>
      <h2 id="other-editors">Using other inline editors</h2>
      <p>
        Some users may want to use Ame handlers without using inline editing
        components like ame-text and ame-rich-text, and that's totally fine.
        The handlers are built in a way that supports any HTML element,
        including form elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that this tree should serialize to the same JSON above:
        <pre>
          <code class="html">
&lt;h1 ame-handler="example" ame-resource="/node/1" ame-path="title.0.value" contenteditable="true"&gt;My title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;textarea ame-handler="example" ame-resource="/node/1" ame-path="body.0.value"&gt;Lorem ipsum!&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;span ame-handler="example" ame-resource="/node/1" ame-path="body.0.format" style="display:none;"&gt;basic_html&lt;/span&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
        Handlers are smart enough to use "innerHTML" for some elements
        (h1, span) "value" for others (textarea).
      </p>
      <h2 id="saving">Saving data</h2>
      <p>
        Every handler included with Ame exposes a "save" method, which should
        serialize the document tree, show validation errors, and send something
        like a PATCH request to the target API.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to note that only <i>changed</i> resources will be saved
        when the save method is called. This is determined by serializing the
        document when the handler is placed on a page, storing that data, then
        comparing it to the current serialized document.
      </p>
      <h2 id="validating">Validating data</h2>
      <p>
        Client side validation should be handled at the component (ame-text)
        level, but handlers are responsible for showing validation errors
        sent by the server back to the client. No validation has been
        implemented for the Drupal (ame-rest-handler) element, yet.
      </p>
      <h2 id="potential">Potential for handlers</h2>
      <p>
        The nature of how handlers work allows for data from multiple APIs
        to be represented and edited on the same page, which is really
        exciting. A frontend application could aggregate data from multiple
        sources (Drupal, Wordpress, Shopify) and allow editors to make
        quick changes without visiting multiple sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is probably not the 80% use case for Ame, but enabling it could
        lead to some interesting implementations.
